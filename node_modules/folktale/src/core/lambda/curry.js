 * Transforms functions on tuples into curried functions.
 *
 * ## Why?
 *
 * Sometimes you want to specify part of the arguments of a function, and
 * leave the other arguments to be specified later. For this you could use
 * an arrow function:
 *
 *     const property = (key, object) => object[key]
 *     people.map(person => property('name', person));
 *
 * Currying allows you to construct functions that support partial application
 * naturally:
 *
 *     const property = curry(2, (key, object) => object[key]);
 *     people.map(property('name'))
 *
 * In essence, currying transforms a function that takes N arguments into
 * N functions that each take 1 argument. In the example above we'd have:
 *
 *     const property = (key, object) => object[key]
 *     curry(2, property)
 *     // => (key) => (object) => object[key]
 *
 *
 * ## Particularities of Folktale's `curry`
 *
 * Because JavaScript is a language where everything is variadic,
 * currying doesn't always fit. To try reducing the problems and
 * work with common JS idioms, currying functions *auto-unroll*
 * application. That is, something like:
 *
 *     const sum = curry(2, (x, y) => x + y)
 *     sum(1, 2, 3)
 *
 * Is handled as:
 *
 *     sum(1, 2)(3)
 *
 * This ensures that curried functions can be properly composed,
 * regardless of how you invoke them. But it also means that
 * passing more arguments to a function than the number of arguments
 * the whole composition takes will probably break your program.

const curry = (arity, fn) => {
  // A curried function; accepts arguments until the number of given
  // arguments is greater or equal to the function's arity.
  const curried = (oldArgs) => (...newArgs) => {
    const allArgs  = oldArgs.concat(newArgs);
    const argCount = allArgs.length;

  };

  // When a curried function receives more arguments than the number
  // of arguments it expects, we need to deal with the overflow.
  // The unrolled invocation takes care of this by passing the
  // remaining arguments to the resulting function.
  // This is required for proper composition of curried functions,
  // but fails with the composition of curried and non-curried
  // functions â€” this library always considers JS functions
  // not generated by *this* function as functions taking an
  // infinite number of arguments.
