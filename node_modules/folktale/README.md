Folktale is a suite of libraries for generic functional programming in
JavaScript that allows you to write elegant modular applications with fewer bugs
and more reuse.


## Installing

The officially supported way of getting Folktale is through [npm][]:

    $ npm install folktale

> **NOTE**
>
> If you don't have npm, you'll need to install [Node.js][] in your
> system before installing Folktale.

A tool like [Browserify][] or [Webpack][] can be used to run Folktale in
platforms that don't implement Node-style modules, like the Browser.

[Node.js]: https://nodejs.org/
[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com
[Browserify]: http://browserify.org/
[Webpack]: https://webpack.github.io/


## Documentation

( TBD )


## Supported platforms

Folktale is supported in all platforms that support ECMAScript 5.

> **NOTE**  
> For platforms that don't support ECMAScript 5, (like IE8 and 9) the
> [es5-shim][] library can be used to provide the additional runtime
> support.
